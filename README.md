the point that it could supplant the visual framework of the
human. Commercial enterprises have made distinctive visual
substitution products by creating numerous hardware to defeat
the challenges of the outwardly debilitated individuals. We are
also having a great advancement in software field too. In
computer science, fields like Machine Learning and Artificial
Intelligence have added life to the computer. They have given
the ability to think and react automatically without the
intervention of the human. So, with the help of machine
learning and artificial intelligence, the challenges of Blind
people can be solved. This project deals with developing an
android application that can extract text from the snapshot of
an instant, and application navigation through Speech
Recognition as the person canâ€™t see. The interface for the
person to the application will be through speech. The future
